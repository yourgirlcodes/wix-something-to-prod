wix-js-validations
-------------------
This library holds the [Javascipt REGEX expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) that are common the Node Server and JS / TS client code for validations.
In some cases, the client validation may be looser", this is  intended and mainly to keep this library lean for consumption in a browser.
> In any case of mismatch between client and server validation result - the server should be the *more robust deciding solution*.
> This is because the server may host libraries and dictionaries that have much more data for full validation.

Future:
> We may bundle this in common infra soon and make it accessible through things like essentials

## How to use this library
```
    yarn add @wix/wix-js-validations
```

Then import any of the REGEX expressions you may need to use.
To see if your input matches the expression use the built in [`test` functionality](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test).

Example:
```typescript
import { phoneRegex } from '@wix/wix-js-validations';

if(phoneRegex.test('0544984161')){
    //Do something with this phone number
} else {
  //Do something about the error state
}
```

As a utility we've also added mappings to the common [Platformization Format Validations](https://bo.wix.com/wix-docs/rnd/platformization-guidelines/protobuf#platformization-guidelines_protobuf_validations).
Example:
```typescript
import { P13NValidations } from '@wix/wix-js-validations';

if(P13NValidations.PHONE.test('0544984161')){
    //Do something with this phone number
} else {
   //Do something about the error state
}
```
