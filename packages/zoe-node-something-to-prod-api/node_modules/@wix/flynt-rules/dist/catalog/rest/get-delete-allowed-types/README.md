# get-delete-allowed-types

Specifications state that GET and DELETE requests MAY contain a body, but Scala FW implementation today ignores body and does not pass it to the service implementation. We want to add a Flynt rule, which would fail build for such request message fields that cannot be expressed via request parameters.

This rule will traverse Request fields of methods that are mapped to GET or DELETE and allow only the following:
* Primitives
* Wrappers (i.e. google.protobuf.StringValue)
* repeated primitives
* "Simple" messages (i.e. messages that contain only primitives or nested simple messages).

Note:
* Value and Struct are not supported
* messages that contain repeated fields are not supported
* repeated wrappers are not supported
