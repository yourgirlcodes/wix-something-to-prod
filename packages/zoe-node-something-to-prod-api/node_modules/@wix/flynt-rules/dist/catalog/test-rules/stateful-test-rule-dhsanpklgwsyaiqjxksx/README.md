# stateful-test-rule-dhsanpklgwsyaiqjxksx

This is a test rule that will always fail if your proto file has a **new** `message` with a name containing this unique string: `dhsanpklgwsyaiqjxksx` 

```proto
message Msg_dhsanpklgwsyaiqjxksx {

}
```

#### Why do I need this?
If you're integrating stateful flynt to a ci-tool and want to write a test that checks how your integration behaves when proto linting
fails, you can rely on this rule to never be changed, otherwise, if you rely on other "standard" rules, 
then, as time goes by, conventions might change, and you'll find that your test stops working.
