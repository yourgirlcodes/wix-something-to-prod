# unsigned-integers-not-allowed

There is no built-in support for unsigned integers in JVM languages and JavaScript, which makes all u_*** types in proto meaningless. The semantics imply that value can never be negative. In proper languages like C / C++ this would be enforced by compiler. In JVM, for example, large numbers defined in proto as unsigned would overflow and become negative. This is a problem for cases where ID, for example, is chosen to be an unsigned.
