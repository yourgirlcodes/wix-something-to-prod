Each error in the rpc method must have its own unique `application_code`.

Example:

```
service Service {
  rpc SomeMethod (SomeMethodRequest) returns (SomeMethodResponse) {
    option (wix.api.error) = {
            http_code: NOT_FOUND
            application_code: "ERROR_CODE"   <-- duplication
        };

    option (wix.api.error) = {
            http_code: NOT_FOUND
            application_code: "ERROR_CODE"   <-- duplication
        };
  }
}
```
