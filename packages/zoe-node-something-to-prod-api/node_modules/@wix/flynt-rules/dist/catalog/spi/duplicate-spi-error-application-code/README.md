Each SPI error in the rpc method must have its own unique `application_code`.

Example:

```
service Service {
  rpc SomeMethod (SomeMethodRequest) returns (SomeMethodResponse) {
    option (wix.spi.error) = {
      name: "SpiError1"
      http_code: NOT_FOUND
      application_code: "ERROR_CODE"   <-- duplication
    };

    option (wix.spi.error) = {
      name: "SpiError2"
      http_code: NOT_FOUND
      application_code: "ERROR_CODE"   <-- duplication
    };
  }
}
```
