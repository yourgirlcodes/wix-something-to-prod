Each SPI error in the rpc method must have its own unique `name`.

Example:

```
service Service {
  rpc SomeMethod (SomeMethodRequest) returns (SomeMethodResponse) {
    option (wix.spi.error) = {
      name: "SpiError"                   <-- duplication
      http_code: NOT_FOUND
      application_code: "ERROR_CODE_1"
    };

    option (wix.spi.error) = {
      name: "SpiError"                   <-- duplication
      http_code: NOT_FOUND
      application_code: "ERROR_CODE_2"   
    };
  }
}
```
