#breaking-field-type-change

This rule checks that a field type change is backward compatible. 
It follows the proto backward compatibility rules defined [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#updating)
For example:
- Changing a field from `int32` to `uint32` is backward compatible
- Changing a field from `string` to `google.protobuf.StringValue` is a breaking change
