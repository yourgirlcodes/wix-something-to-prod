# Locale Dataset JavaScript

By using this library you can retrieve metadata about countries, states, currencies, locales and timezones that will later be used in order to fetch their translations, by [`locale-dataset-data`](../locale-dataset-data).

## Install

```sh
npm i @wix/locale-dataset-javascript
```

## Usage

```javascript
import localeData from '@wix/locale-dataset-javascript';

localeData.getAllCountries();
```

## React & i18next

In case you use React and i18next libs, see [how you can easily integrate translations](./REACT-I18NEXT.md) in your app doc.

## API

All entities can be found in the [typings file](../locale-dataset-data/typings.d.ts) of locale dataset definitions.
